## Security

### Access Rights (ir.model.access)
- Every model needs at least one ACL entry in `ir.model.access.csv`.
- Format: `id,name,model_id:id,group_id:id,perm_read,perm_write,perm_create,perm_unlink`.
- Use `base.group_user` for internal users, `base.group_portal` for portal, `base.group_public` for public.
- Grant minimum necessary permissions — follow the principle of least privilege.
- If no `group_id` is set, the rule applies to all users (global ACL).

### Record Rules (ir.rule)
- Record rules filter which records a group can access via domains.
- Global rules (no group) apply to ALL users and are combined with AND.
- Group rules are combined with OR between groups, then AND with global rules.
- Define in `security/security.xml`.
- Use `noupdate="1"` for rules that admins may want to customize.

### Security Groups
- Define groups in XML: `<record model="res.groups">`.
- Use `implied_ids` for group inheritance (e.g. Manager implies User).
- Use `category_id` to organize groups under application categories.
- Reference groups in views with `groups="module.group_xml_id"`.

### Common Pitfalls
- Never use `sudo()` to work around access rights bugs — fix the ACLs instead.
- Always test as a non-admin user to verify access rules.
- Don't forget security on wizard (transient) models — they need ACLs too.
- Sanitize user input in controllers — Odoo's ORM handles SQL injection but not XSS.
- Use `fields.Html` with `sanitize=True` for user-provided HTML content.
