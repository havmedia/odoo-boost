## Odoo 17 Specific Notes

### Key Changes in Odoo 17
- **New list view tag**: Use `<list>` instead of `<tree>` (both still work but `<list>` is preferred).
- **Upgraded OWL**: OWL 2 is the standard. Components use `setup()` instead of `constructor()`.
- **Asset bundling**: New asset bundle system using `__manifest__.py` `assets` key with glob patterns.
- **Form view attrs removal**: `attrs` attribute is deprecated. Use `invisible`, `readonly`, `required` directly as expressions.
  ```xml
  <!-- Old (pre-17) -->
  <field name="x" attrs="{'invisible': [('state', '=', 'draft')]}"/>
  <!-- New (17+) -->
  <field name="x" invisible="state == 'draft'"/>
  ```
- **Markup utility**: Use `Markup` from `markupsafe` for safe HTML in Python, replacing `tools.html_sanitize` in many cases.

### Deprecated / Removed in v17
- `<tree>` tag still works but `<list>` is preferred in new code.
- `attrs` dict syntax on view elements is deprecated in favor of inline expressions.
- `@api.multi` was already removed — do not use it.
- `ir.values` model no longer exists (removed in v11, but sometimes referenced in old docs).

### Search Views
- The `<group>` element in search views takes no documented attributes in v17, but `expand` and `string` are still tolerated (e.g. `<group expand="0" string="Group By">`).
- The `string` attribute on the `<search>` root element is not displayed anywhere — it is inert but still passes validation.

### Recommended Patterns
- Use the new expression syntax for view conditions: `invisible="not is_company"`.
- Use `env.ref()` instead of `self.env['ir.model.data']._xmlid_to_res_id()`.
- Use `Command` constants for one2many/many2many write operations: `Command.create()`, `Command.update()`, `Command.delete()`, `Command.link()`, `Command.unlink()`, `Command.set()`, `Command.clear()`.
