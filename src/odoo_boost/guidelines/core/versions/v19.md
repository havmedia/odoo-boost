## Odoo 19 Specific Notes

### Key Changes in Odoo 19
- **Everything from v17/v18 applies** — v19 builds on those changes.
- **Python 3.12+ required**: Take advantage of newer Python features.
- **`<tree>` is removed**: Only `<list>` is supported for list views.
- **Improved typing**: Better type hints in Odoo's own codebase.
- **Enhanced OWL**: Continued improvements to the OWL framework and developer experience.
- **Performance focus**: Various ORM and query optimizations.

### Recommended v19 Patterns
- Use `<list>` exclusively — `<tree>` will cause errors.
- Inline expressions for view conditions are the only option (no `attrs`).
- Leverage Python 3.12+ features: type parameter syntax, f-string improvements.
- Use modern `Command` API for all relational field operations.
- Use `self.env.flush_all()` when you need to ensure computed fields are written to DB before SQL queries.

### Migration Notes (from v18 to v19)
- Replace any remaining `<tree>` tags with `<list>`.
- Verify all view expressions use the inline syntax.
- Check for deprecated API usage flagged in v18 that's removed in v19.
- Test with Python 3.12+ — some third-party libraries may need updates.
